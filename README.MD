**Description;**
Hello everyone! In this article, we will talk about the aluminum Voltage Indicator PCB we designed for our electric vehicle YTR08E by YTU Racing in the Formula Student competition, the world's most prestigious undergraduate engineering competition, attended by university students from all over the world who are interested in motor racing

**About the Voltage Indicator PCB;**

As a Formula Student rules, each accumulator container must have a prominent indicator when high voltage is present at the vehicle side of the AIRs (accumulator isolation relays). Also the voltage indicator must always function, including when the accumulator container is disconnected or removed. The voltage indicator light is located in a place where it can be clearly seen even when the accumulator connections are plugged in and unplugged. If there is a voltage above 60 volts in the vehicle, the voltage indicator light should turn on. LM358 dual operational amplifiers were used to compare the TS (tractive system) voltage with a constant voltage to detect voltage in the vehicle. Even if there is no LV (low voltage) battery in the vehicle, the supply and inputs of the opamp must be from HV (high voltage) source for the light to turn on. The only problem with this design is that the output current is 0.5 mA at 0-450V difference. In order to light the LED, we can use a high voltage transistor to increase the current and turn on the LED light. You can set the output voltage to your desired value in the typical application circuit below.

**How to order PCB at JLCPCB;**  
  
This design is sponsored by JLCPCB. After designing the circuit however you want, you can order your PCB and get it to your hand in a short time! We would like to thank JLCPCB for their support and we are very satisfied with the service we received. First, you have to export GERBER and NC files of your PCB files. JLCPCB explained how to do it you can visit the website. They communicate very quickly in the format of the PCB gerber file or in case determination that may cause any problems in terms of production and they deliver the PCB without any problems.  [https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/42-how-to-expo...](https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/42-how-to-expor...)  After that put the files into single rar file then get to the order page You are even able to change PCB color for free. You can change the shipping method. JLCPCB ensures the delivery PCB to your hand for 3 days! You can check the website of JLCPCB. We want to thank again to JLCPCB for the great quality of its service.

JLCPCB SMT Parts Library has 200k+ in-stock components (689 Basic components and 200k+ Extended components)

You can build your library Inventory, save parts for now or in the future Assembly which will be supported with 10M+ parts by Digikey, mouser, This benefits customers to source components much faster and easier, bringing you a shorter PCBA production time You can Get PCBA products in one week, from ordering, parts sourcing, and PCBA prototyping Your PCBs are passing JLCPCB’s special tests such as inspection in JLCPCB’s high-tech facility and visual tests, X-ray test is used to check the quality of the solder joints (such as BGA) under the components on the line to ensure that the circuit board can achieve 100% test coverage, solder paste inspections, SPI which is checking in advance whether there is a lack of poor solder paste printing, AOI, the surface of the object can be checked correctly (but for objects hidden under the part or on the edge of the part) The solder joints may be out of reach) You can get your PCB soldered in many different ways such as hand-soldering, reﬂow soldering, and wave soldering. Your PCBs are produced on a first-class production line adopted with an advanced Yamaha automatic placement machine all those machines are equipped electric feeder, a 10 temperature zone lead-free reflow soldering, automatic printing machine. SMT production line has functioned such as sorting, rectification, cleaning, literacy, and production line discipline management.

  
Thank you, JLCPCB !
